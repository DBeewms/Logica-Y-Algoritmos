## Repository Description

### Exercises in C, C++, and PSeInt

This repository contains a series of practical exercises and examples to help you understand the basic concepts of programming logic and algorithms. The exercises are implemented in three different languages:

- **C**: A low-level programming language, ideal for understanding the fundamentals of computing.
- **C++**: An extension of C that adds object-oriented features.
- **PSeInt**: A tool for learning to program in a simple way, especially designed for beginners.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Examples**: Contains basic code examples in C, C++, and PSeInt. Basic problems to understand the structure of an algorithm.
- **Practical Exercises**: Includes a series of solved exercises and challenges for you to practice. More complex challenges to help you improve your programming skills.

## Code Examples

Below, you will find a basic example of code in each language:

### C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world in C!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world in C++!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### PSeInt
```pseint
Algoritmo HolaMundo
    Escribir "Hello, world in PSeInt!"
FinAlgoritmo
```
